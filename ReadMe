Setup:
First "make program" with both the funkits plugged in. 
Ensure that the funkits are turned on.

The loading phase:
When both the funkits have the program loaded the message PONG should move accross the screen.
When this occurs turn the funkits sideways facing the IR sensor towards eachother. 
Once you and your opponent are facing eachother press the "Button" on the funkit to go to the next phase.

The Setup phase:
Once the "Button" is pressed the screen message will change to "Click to spawn ball". 
When this occurs one of the players who wants to start with the ball presses down on the "Nav Switch"
Then the game will start

The Game phase:
To move the Racket the player moves left or right on the "Nav Switch" (In the dirrection of the player)
The racket cannot go off the sides of the screen.
The Ball will move towards the dirrection of the player unless hit by a player
To hit the ball place your Nav switch behind where the next ball possition will be. 
Overtime the ball will speed up.
To win make it so the ball hits the end tiles of the opponent (The pixels where the opponents racket is)

The End phase:
Once one player loses the game will end and it will go to the end phase.
This is where A message will pop-up saying "YOU WIN" or "YOU LOSE" depending on the outcome. 
Press the "Nav Switch" down to end.
